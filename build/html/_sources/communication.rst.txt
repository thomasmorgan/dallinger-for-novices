Communication between the Server and Participants
=================================================

So far we have looked in detail at the various kinds of objects that are created when Dallinger runs an experiment and stored in the database. Moreover, we have seen how Experiments act as a set of instructions that determine what happend to the database. Collectively all this stuff is often referred to as the "back end". But so far Dallinger has been running in an isolated bubble. We've discussed how an Experiment might add a Node to a Network, but we haven't covered how the Experiment knows *when* is the appropriate time to do this. Similarly, we know that the decisions a participant makes will get stored as the *contents* of an Info in the databae, but how do we communcate what the participant's decision is from their computer back to the server? This requires us to improve our knowledge of the "front end" - everything that goes on on the participants' computers instead of just on our server. The front end is going to be the focus of the nexet several chapters and by the end you should be able to see how the elaborate dance of Nodes, Infos and Transmissions that takes place in the databases is constrantly being nudged, prodded and prompted by instructions coming not just from the Experiment class, but also from the participants themselves.

First, we'll cover server routes. These are like open channels of communication on the server that listen for incoming communication from the outside world. These are where our participants will send their messages, or rather the experimenter will build a front end that sends messages to these routes that communcate what the participant has done.

Next we'll take a brief detour into notifications, which are really a special type of server route, but they're big and complicated looking so we'll spin them off into a separate section.

After this we'll start discussing how you can build a front end that sends these messages to these server routes. First you'll need to learn a bit about three more programming languages: html, css and javascript. These are used to build the interface that participants interact with, in particular, javascript adds functionality and makes the user interface actually "do stuff". After this, we'll dig into a javascript library offered by dallinger than makes things like sending messages to the server much easier than having to do it from scratch yourself. Finally, we'll return to the demos and see how their front ends work.
